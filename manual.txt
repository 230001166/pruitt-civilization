 = Civilization Focuses =

Civilizations can choose areas to focus on such as economics and military for a few turns.

 - Focuses -

Construction - +15% Production when constructing buildings

Economic - +15% GPT

Military - +15% Research speed for Military technologies

Population - +10% Population growth


 = Production =

Production is influenced by several factors when building units and cities in the game.

The happiness of a civilization, the surrounding terrain, and said civilization's economic status all have an impact on the production output of your civilization.

 = Terrain Types =

Terrain Character - Type - Food Yield - Production Yield

Blank space - Ocean - 1 - 0
"-" - Coast - 1 - 0
"#" - Grassland - 2 - 0
"*" - Forest - 1 - 1
"^" - Mountain - 0 - 2
"s" - Snow - 0 - 0
"." - Desert - 0 - 0

Terrain matters in more than how much food and production it gives, however : terrain is also very important in combat.

For example, Horsemen excel in flat terrain like Grasslands but are much weaker attacking on terrain such as Mountains.

In this example, the Horseman attacking in Grasslands would deal 10% more damage than normal, but the Horseman attacking in the Mountains would deal 55% less damage.


Because terrain plays such an important role in combat, it is also a good idea to keep it in mind when settling new cities. 
If you are more concerned with defending your civilization, settle cities near Mountains and Forests to give nearby units defensive boosts from the terrain.

 = Unit Upkeep =

Unit upkeep can be changed in this game.

There is a base upkeep value when you set the upkeep you will spend on units each turn : set your upkeep lower than the base value, and they will do poorly in combat.
However, if you spend more than necessary on upkeep, your units will perform better in combat.
